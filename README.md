# Unsupervised-Myopia-Modeling
This repository reads in a csv with medical information of children, some who suffer from Myopia and some who do not. The jupyter notebook contains code to see whether or not distinct clusters can be identified using PCA dimension reduction and TSNE as well as using K-means to analyze the clusters.
